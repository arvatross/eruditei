                    <p><b>Eruditei</b> is a project of a groups of students at St. Cecilia's College-Cebu, Inc
                    for their capstone project. The main purpose of the system is to create a program that will integrate
                    the learning materials prepared by the instructors or the teachers so that students will still be able to
                    learn remotely and connect with their teachers. The system offers interactive course outlines that can handle
                    different type of media. <br/> <br/> Education is very important for them and that's what pushed them to create this kind of program that would surely
                    be able to help other people specially those who are less fortunate and those who cannot go to school.
